Seeking the lost-yes, kindly entreating
Wanderers on the mountain astray
"Come unto Me," His message repeating,
Words of the Master speaking today.
Refrain
Ladies: (Going afar) (Upon the mountain)
Men: Going afar Upon the moun-tain
Ladies: (Bringing the wand'rer back again,) back again
Men: Bringing the wand'+rer back again, back again
Ladies: Into the fold of my Redeemer,
Men: Into the fold of my Redeem-er
Ladies: (Jesus the Lamb +for sinners slain,) for sinners slain
Men: Jesus, the lamb +for sinners slain, for sinners slain
2
Seeking the lost-and pointing to Jesus
Souls that are weak and hearts that are sore,
Leading them forth in ways of salvation,
Showing the path to life evermore.
3
Thus I would go on missions of mercy
Following Christ from day unto day,
Cheering the faint and raising the fallen,
Pointing the lost to Jesus, the Way

NOTE: On the refrain, the men start, the ladies echo, and the voices join again at the
+'s.
