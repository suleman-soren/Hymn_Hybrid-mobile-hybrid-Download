God of our fathers,
whose almighty hand
Leads forth in beauty
all the starry band
Of shining world in
splendor through the skies,
Our grateful songs
before Thy throne arise.
2
Thy love divine hath
led us in the past,
In this free land by
Thee our lots is cast;
Be Thou our ruler,
guardian, guide, and stay,
Thy word our law,
Thy paths our chosen way.
3
From war's alarms,
from deadly pestilence,
Be Thy strong arm our
ever sure defense;
Thy true religion in
our hearts increase,
Thy bounteous goodness
nourish us in peace.
4
Refresh Thy people on
their toilsome way,
Lead us from night
to never-ending day;
Fill all our lives with
love and grace divine,
And glory, laud, and
praise be ever Thine.
