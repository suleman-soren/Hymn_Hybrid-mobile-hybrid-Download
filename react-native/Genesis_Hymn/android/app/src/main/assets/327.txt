I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold;
I'd rather be His than have riches untold:
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand
Refrain
Than to be the king of a vast domain
Or be held in sin's dread sway.
I'd rather have Jesus tan anything
This world affords today.
2
I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause;
I rather be faithful to His dear cause;
Id rather have Jesus than worldwide fame.
I'd rather be true to His holy name.
3
He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom;
He's sweeter than honey from out the comb;
He's all than my hungering spirit needs.
I'd rather hav Jesus and let Him lead
